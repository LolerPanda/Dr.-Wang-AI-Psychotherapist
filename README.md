## Why Dr. Wang?


Hey, what's up? I'm Wang, and I'm the dude behind this awesome AI psychotherapy project. Let me tell you a bit about myself and why I made this project.

I've been dealing with depression for a long time. It sucked big time. I felt like crap all the time. Nothing made me happy anymore. I pushed away my friends and family. I had no energy to do anything. I wanted to end it all many times.

I was scared to get professional help. I thought it was lame and weak. I thought nobody would get me. I thought I was the only one in this hellhole.

But then, something changed. I found this online platform that offered free therapy sessions. I decided to give it a shot, even though I was doubtful and nervous. I chatted with a cool and nice therapist named Audrey who listened to me without judging me. She helped me figure out my feelings and thoughts better. She taught me some skills and tricks to cope with my depression. She pushed me to get more help and treatment.

Slowly, I started to feel better. I got some hope and confidence back. I reconnected with my peeps. I got back into my passions and hobbies. I found a new reason to live.

I realized how amazing and helpful therapy can be. I also realized how many people are going through the same crap as me, but don't have access to good and cheap therapy services. That's why I decided to create this AI psychotherapy project.

This project is here to give you personalized, easy, and effective AI-powered digital therapy whenever you need it. It uses smart tech to talk to you like a real person and interact with you. It offers different kinds of therapies that work, such as CBT, mindfulness, and positive psychology. It also hooks you up with professional therapists and support groups if you want.

I hope this project can help you kick your mental health problems in the butt and make you feel good. I hope it can make you feel less lonely and more understood. I hope it can motivate you to get more help and healing.

You are not alone. You are not hopeless. You are not worthless. You rock and you deserve love and happiness.

Thanks for hearing me out and joining this project. Together, we can change the game in the mental health world.
